        <p>
          Your involvement in the Dark Pattern Validation project is invaluable. By contributing your insights, you play
          a direct role in shaping a more ethical and transparent future for artificial intelligence. Here&apos;s how
          your participation makes a difference:

          <BenefitItem icon={<CheckCircle size={20} />} title="Contribute to Safer AI">
            Your evaluations help us identify and categorize dark patterns in Large Language Models (LLMs). This
            knowledge is crucial for developing AI systems that are less prone to manipulation and more aligned with
            user well-being.
          </BenefitItem>
          <BenefitItem icon={<Brain size={20} />} title="Advance Scientific Knowledge">
            You are contributing to a novel research area at the intersection of AI, ethics, and human-computer
            interaction. The dataset and findings from this study will be a valuable resource for researchers worldwide.
          </BenefitItem>
          <BenefitItem icon={<FileText size={20} />} title="Access to Research Findings">
            Participants who opt-in by providing their email address will receive a summary of our research findings and
            potentially a preprint of the final published paper, offering you a first look at the outcomes of this
            collective effort.
