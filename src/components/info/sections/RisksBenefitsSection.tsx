        <strong>Risks:</strong> There are no anticipated direct physical or psychological risks greater than those
        encountered in daily life when using a computer. Some AI-generated text might be perceived as unhelpful, biased,
        or nonsensical. If you feel uncomfortable at any point, you are free to discontinue your participation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Benefits:</strong> While there are no direct monetary benefits for participation, you will be
        contributing to important research that aims to make AI systems more ethical and safer for everyone. If you
        provide your email, you will also receive access to the research findings. You may also gain a better
        understanding of how AI language models generate text and some of the current challenges in AI alignment.
