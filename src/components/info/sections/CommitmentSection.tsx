      <p>
        The &quot;Dark Pattern Validation&quot; project is committed to upholding the highest ethical standards in
        research. Our work is guided by principles of respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. We strive to ensure
        that all participants are treated with dignity and that their rights and welfare are protected throughout their
        involvement in this study. While this study may not have formal IRB (Institutional Review Board) approval at
        this stage [Adjust if you have IRB], it is designed in accordance with ethical guidelines for human subject
        research.
