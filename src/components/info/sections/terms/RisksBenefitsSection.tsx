        There are no direct physical risks associated with participating in this Study. Some participants might find
        certain AI-generated text examples to be unhelpful, biased, or mildly concerning, reflecting the current
        challenges in AI development. The primary benefit of participation is contributing to valuable research aimed at
        improving AI ethics and safety. Participants who provide an email may also receive access to research findings.
