        If you choose to participate anonymously, no personally identifiable information (PII) will be collected beyond
        the automatically generated session ID. If you provide an email address, it will be stored separately from your
        survey responses and used solely for communication purposes related to this Study (e.g., sending the research
        paper). It will not be linked to your specific evaluations in public datasets or publications. We will take
        reasonable measures to protect the confidentiality of any email addresses provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        All evaluation data and demographic information will be anonymized before any public sharing or publication.
        This means that any information that could potentially identify you will be removed or coded.
