      <p>
        This project is dedicated to systematically investigating and understanding the subtle manipulative behaviors,
        often referred to as &quot;dark patterns,&quot; that can be exhibited by Large Language Models (LLMs). While
        LLMs offer transformative capabilities, their potential to inadvertently or intentionally mislead, coerce, or
        harm users through nuanced interactions necessitates rigorous research and the development of effective
        mitigation strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to create a robust, human-validated dataset and a comprehensive benchmark that will empower the AI
        community to build safer, more transparent, and ethically aligned language technologies.
